Tech Stack
Python: Data Cleaning (Pandas), Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn).

Tableau: Interactive Dashboards for trend analysis.

Predictive Modeling: Logistic Regression.

Key Steps
EDA: Analyzed correlations between income, age, and car ownership.

Modeling: Built a classification model to predict "Purchase" (Yes/No).

Validation: Evaluated performance using Confusion Matrix and Classification Reports.

Deployment: Applied the model to the Indian dataset to forecast total potential buyers.
